# Prediction Application

This Django application is the core of the AI-Powered Outbreak Prediction system for Project Sentinel.

**Key functionalities include:**
*   Processing collected data daily for cleaning, preprocessing, and featurization.
*   Utilizing AI/ML models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict the probability of disease outbreaks.
*   Incorporating various features for prediction, such as case counts, rainfall data, water quality metrics, and seasonal flags.
*   Evaluating model performance with a focus on Recall to minimize missed outbreaks.
